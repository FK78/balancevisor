## What it does

BalanceVisor is a full-stack personal finance app. You connect your bank (TrueLayer Open Banking) or add accounts manually, and the app tracks everything from daily spending to long-term investment performance. There's an AI assistant powered by Groq that can parse natural language into transactions and auto-categorise spending.

## Features

**Dashboard** — Net worth across accounts + investments, month-over-month trends, recent transactions, spending breakdown, cashflow chart, budget progress bars, and savings goals.

**Accounts** — Current accounts, savings, credit cards, investments. Balances auto-adjust when transactions are added/edited/deleted.

**Transactions** — Income/expense tracking with categories, recurring patterns (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly/yearly), CSV import with column mapping, and data export. Split transactions supported.

**Categories** — Custom categories with colours and icons. Rule-based auto-categorisation with AI fallback (Groq) for imported or manually entered transactions.

**Budgets** — Monthly or weekly spending limits per category. Threshold alerts via browser notifications and email (Resend). Notification bell in the navbar.

**Goals** — Savings goals with target amounts, deadlines, and contribution tracking.

**Debt Tracker** — Track debts with interest rates, minimum payments, and payoff progress.

**Subscriptions** — Recurring subscription tracking.

**Reports** — Spending insights and analytics.

### AI

- **Smart Categorisation** — When no rule matches a transaction, Groq's `openai/gpt-oss-20b` picks the best category from the user's list. Falls back gracefully if the API is down or no key is configured.
- **Natural Language Transactions** — Type something like "£45 Tesco groceries yesterday" and the AI parses it into a structured transaction with the right account, category, amount, and date. Powered by the `/api/parse-transaction` route.
- **Chat Assistant** — Conversational AI in a slide-out panel for financial questions, accessible from any dashboard page.

### Investments

- **Trading 212** — Connect with your API key + secret (HTTP Basic Auth). Syncs account summary and open positions for both Live and Demo environments.
- **Manual Holdings** — Search tickers via Yahoo Finance, track quantity and cost basis. Prices auto-refresh when stale (>15 min).
- **Investment Groups** — Organise holdings into custom groups with colours and icons.
- **Portfolio View** — Total value, gain/loss, cost basis cards. Allocation pie chart, per-holding bar chart, unified holdings table.

### Open Banking

- **TrueLayer** — OAuth flow to link UK bank accounts. Accounts and transactions import automatically on connect and on every login (hourly throttle). Manual "Sync Now" button as fallback. Supports sandbox and production environments.

### PWA

Installable as a Progressive Web App on mobile and desktop. Service worker provides offline fallback, font caching, and stale-while-revalidate for static assets. Custom install prompt with dismiss-and-remember logic.

### Security

All sensitive data encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM: account names, transaction descriptions, TrueLayer OAuth tokens, Trading 212 API credentials. Encryption key stored as an environment variable, never committed.
